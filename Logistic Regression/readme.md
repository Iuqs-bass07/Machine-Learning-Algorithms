### This repository contains an implementation of a Logistic Regressor from scratch in Python, utilizing two distinct approaches:

Perceptron Trick
Gradient Descent with Binary Cross-Entropy Loss

### Overview
Logistic regression is a fundamental classification algorithm in machine learning, used for binary classification tasks. This project showcases how to implement a Logistic Regressor using two methods:

Perceptron Trick: 
An algorithm that updates weights based on misclassified points, working similarly to a perceptron but using the logistic function for updates.

Gradient Descent with Binary Cross-Entropy Loss: 
An iterative optimization technique that minimizes the binary cross-entropy loss using the sigmoid function for classification.
