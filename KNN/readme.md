#### This repo contains the implementation of the KNN. It is very intuitive and simple algorithm which works on the fact that the behaviour of a point in a multidimension space depends upon the behaviour of its neighbours

##### KNN Has been inplemented in parts

###### Decision Metric Class

This parts Calculate the different kinds of distance which KNN uses to find the nearest neighbour

  1- Euclidean

  2- Manhattan

  3- Minkowski

  4- Hamming

###### KNN Class

  1- Training
  
  2- Finding Neighbours

  3- Taking the Majority count
