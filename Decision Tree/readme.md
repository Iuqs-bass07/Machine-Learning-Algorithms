## Decision Tree Implementation

This part of the repo contains the implementation of the decision tree algorithm for the classification. It use the entropy and gini impurity method to calculate the information gain for each of the column avialable and them cuts the data into two part depending on the maxi information gain

Decision Tree
1- Classification Tree
    Information Gain 

2- Regression Tree
    Variance Spread
