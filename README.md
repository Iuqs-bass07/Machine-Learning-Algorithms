This repo contains the implementation of most of the classical Machine Learning algorithm from Scratch
The Algorithms which have been implemented are:
  1- Linear Regression
      a) Close form Solutions
      b) Gradient Descent Optimization
          i) Batch Gradient Descent
          ii) Stochastic Gradient Descent
  2- Logistic Regression
      a) Perceptron Trick
      b) Gradient Descent
